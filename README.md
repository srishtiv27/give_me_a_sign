# give_me_a_sign

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is used in the deaf community all over India. But ISL is not used in deaf schools to teach deaf children. Teacher training programs do not orient teachers towards teaching methods that use ISL. There is no teaching material that incorporates sign language. Parents of deaf children are not aware about sign language and its ability to remove communication barriers. ISL interpreters are an urgent requirement at institutes and places where communication between deaf and hearing people takes place but India has only less than 300 certified interpreters.  
Often schools are not capable of supplying their deaf or hard-of-hearing students with the proper technology that could significantly increase the learning development process. We aim to provide a solution to this problem through our app which aids people in learning ISL through short videos, games and fun quizzes. This would encourage people to learn ISL so that they can interact with people with impaired hearing in a better way. It could also be useful for younger kids with hearing disabilities to learn ISL in a fun and interactive way.
